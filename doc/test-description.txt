The following test-set demonstrates the functionality of the application,
but is not very comprehensive. The application was tested on a different test-set 
(created by other students) for my own verification purposes, but I do not include
it in the archive. My test cases may also help fill gaps in the assignment.

Running the tests (make sure the application is compiled and up-to-date using make):

  ./runTests.sh

Test descriptions:

1. Empty input error
2. Missing alphabet error
3. Missing initial symbol error
4. Minimal valid grammar
5. Complex example with empty lines between rules
6. Grammar that is already simplified. (Each flag is identity)
7. Duplicate non-terminal error
8. Duplicate terminal error
9. Starting symbol not in N error
10. Duplicate rule error
